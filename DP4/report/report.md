#### ***[POV & Tasks]***

As it is stated in DP3, we will focus on the people who want to record their exercises while they are working out. Throughout several interviews, it was possible to notice that writing down of exercise record is annoying and inconvenient regardless of writing devices such as papers or smartphones. These people would have the need of doing so easier and faster.
At this point, we want to clarify the terminology we mixed up in their usage. The first combination of terms which caused our ambiguous understanding in their difference is “workout” and “exercise”. We thought the two words are synonym, but those words actually have slightly different context. Working out and exercise both indicate the physical activities to enhance one’s body strength, but exercise usually indicates one specific activity or sports, while workout is inferring whole activity, consisting of several different exercises.
Each exercise needs different attributes to record, and these values depend on the nature of exercise. Most of muscle exercises would contain weight, reps(=repetitions), sets and interval(=resting period between each set, unit=seconds), but cardio exercise or abs routine(=abdominal muscle exercise) would need different attributes to record. These issues would be probably dealt in the process of redesigning thoroughly under our POV

TASKS for prototype

First task: Select and Add new workout plan

Alignment to POV:
Whenever a user wants to record an exercise, he/she has to select which exercise to be done, including all attributes. The user may record all of the workout contents, either before or after the workout. Since our main goal is to minimize the effort of recording the workout, this task is the most essential and primitive step to be done in our service

Description:
Since it is the most fundamental feature of our design project, it is somewhat mandatory to include as a task. One thing to point out is that user should click twice to add certain exercise: user select the body part first, and then choose the exercise corresponding to that body part (depth = 2).
Since this is lo-fi prototype, not all exercises are included and not all the categories of each exercise are specified. Some exercise may require another steps (depth >= 3). If so, we should utilize index tree figure in the selection of exercises to be added.

Second task: Change the state of each exercise (choose either Done/Edit/Delete)

Alignment to POV:
This task is about the feature that allows user to record fast and easier during workout. Our current prototype presumably contains many issues on usability, it is expected to find out the way to improve it.

Description:
It is assumed that exercise tasks are already selected and added in this step. Users are asked to mark the tasks as done, edit the attributes, or delete it to test the features supported by the system.

Third task: load previously-made workout plan

Alignment to POV:
By enabling users to save and load workout template, it is possible for user to record exercises within shorter amount of time. We noticed the fact that workout routines usually categorized by each body part, and the routines for the same body part are usually similar. By adopting the exercises and their attributes from the past records, it would be possible to minimize users’ effort for recording their exercises.

Description:
Users can load workout routines which are previously built by themselves. It is not reflected to our current prototype, but we will also allow users to choose to load from both “user-made” and “user-done”.
