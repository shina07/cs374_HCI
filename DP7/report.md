# DP7 : User Testing

## Written protocol

### Instructions for preparation

#### Place

**Health club at KAIST** (Anywhere users prefer is OK because in doing so we can focus the user's actual usage for our application without any interference by unfriendly situation)

#### Expected time for each participants

About **30minutes**, not included interview time. (It is very loosely appropriated so that users don't have to care about the time limit.)

#### Recording

Using smartphone, we will record the entire session that our participants take the experiment. It includes voice recordings, photos, written notes.

#### Individual roles

1 facilitator and 3 observers (Except facilitator and one observer who records the participants, the others should take a distance to the user in order for user to concentrate their workout.)

Facilitator : (name)

Observers : (name), (name), (name)

#### Environment

All the participants should use the same device for testing. Don't let them use their own device. We recommend to use mobile device, not laptop.

- In mobile **[Recommended]** - Chrome application.
- In laptop - Chrome browser. Only using mobile mode in development tool(shortcut: F12). Toggle device toolbar(shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M) and select "Galaxy S5" at leftmost dropdown menu in device toolbar header.

#### Accounts for test

The ID must be made before the experiment depending on the user's unique number like student ID. So, collect the student ID or some unique number (not just ordering) for "userID" space. (The reason why we don't use order number for "userID" is that users don't have to know which order they take experiment. This might affect to the user's mentality.)

> In train session - ID = train_userID & PW = 0000 w/o pre-dataset.
> 
> In test session - ID = test_userID & PW = 0000 w/ pre-dataset.

#### Pre-dataset

There should be pre-dataset in test account.

> 3 past days, 2-3 workouts for each day, 3-6 sets for each workout, no plan at the day.

### Introduction

> Your workout is a real training session only if you have specific goals, a planned vision of progress and a way to measure your results. From this reason, some people record their workouts. However, tracking workouts is an annoying task. Our team has focused on **"How to track your workouts in the simplest, most effective way possble"**.
> 
> MACHOKE - your workout note - is designed for providing technical aids to reduce the troublesomeness of recording workout results and to make the process of tracking each exercise details easier.
> 
> And we want to test the usability of our product by this user testing, and get some feedbacks.

### Informed consent

> I confirm that the participant was given an opportunity to ask questions about the user testing, and all the questions asked by the participant have been answered correctly and to the best of my ability. I confirm that the individual has not been coerced into giving consent, and the consent has been given freely and voluntarily.

### Task list

#### **Task 1**: Log in and add new plans

Because we should observe if the user can find a specific workout easily, we made some constraints like workout name, weight, and repetition.

> You have your own ID and password for user testing. First, please log in our service with given account, and add new workout plans with following conditions : You are going to do five sets of bench press. You will use 20kg barbell and repeat 10 times for the first set, but repetition will be gradually increased by 2.

#### **Task 2**: Complete workout plans

The users use our service while they are exercising, so user testing also will be go along in the same condition. The participants really do their worktout, and we have to observe their behavior.

> Next, please follow these steps : **1.** Assume that you don't know how to do this exercise (barbell press). Try to find any help about how can you do this. **2.** You did the first set. Change your current plan to complete and go to the second set. **3.** You did only 8 times for the second set. Change the repetition 12 to 8 for your current plan. **4.** Do all the remainging plans, and go to the main screen.

#### **Task 3**: Load previous plans

> You can load a list of plans you have done before. Because the test account has some previous dataset, assume that you have used our service. Open the calendar, and then, try to load plans you did on 29. May.

### Questionnaires

#### Overall

- Give us a short comment, review or anything that comes in your mind, please.
- Did you find our service useful? If so, which features or aspects were impressive?
- Was our overall design (including buttons, header, front page, etc) looked fancy enough?
- Is there anything you need while doing exercise, which is beyond our service?

#### Adding plan

- Was there any inconvenience while adding new workout plan? If so, let us know so that we can improve our service.

#### Daily plan list & Recording exercises

- How did you like our list view which showed each one's daily routine?
- Was there any notable inconvenience while doing an exercise with our UI?
- How was our timer which showed your rest interval between sets? Was it learnable?

#### Loading workout routines from calendar

- How do you often do workout routime that is similar to the one you'd done in the past?
- How did you like our calendar? Was there any good or bads?
- Did you find any inconvenience while loading?

### Debrief prompt

Our team is planning to show out our gratitude towards paricipants by giving our starbucks or equivalent gifticon as we did in the previous user testings. (paper & low-fi prototypes)

## Session observations

> Participants: Who are they? How did you recruit them? Why are they representative target users? Add brief demographic, context information about each participant that is relevant to your interface.

> Use at least one photo or sketch for each participant and provide a summary description of each session (e.g., What was unique about this participant? Main takeaway from this participant?).

## Usability lessons

> List at least 10 usability problems you discovered. Organize them by high-level task or theme, not by each participant or time. But mention which participant ran into the problem by referring to them as P1, P2, ... (e.g., search results did not show the price information (P1, P3)). For each problem, indicate how critical the problem is: high, medium, and low. Finally, show how you plan to address each of the problems.

> High-level reflections: What did you overall learn from the user testing experience? What would you do differently for better results and insights?

## Studio reflections

> Summarize the feedback from the studio session, and mention how you addressed it or will address it later in the process.

## Plan for iteration

> You'll have an additional week to finalize your overall design process. Discuss in your team how to use this time most effectively, and make a few concrete goals. Justify your goals.
