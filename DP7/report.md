# DP7 : User Testing

## Written protocol

### Instructions for preparation

#### Place

**Health club at KAIST** (Anywhere users prefer is OK because in doing so we can focus the user's actual usage for our application without any interference by unfriendly situation)

#### Expected time for each participants

About **30minutes**, not included interview time. (It is very loosely appropriated so that users don't have to care about the time limit.)

#### Recording

Using smartphone, we will record the entire session that our participants take the experiment. It includes screen captures, written notes.

#### Individual roles

1 facilitator and 3 observers (Except facilitator and one observer who records the participants, the others should take a distance to the user in order for user to concentrate their workout.)

Facilitator : Seunghee

Observers : Minyeong, Taesoo, Hyeongcheol

#### URL

URL of our prototype is [here](https://project-oh-hack-nyun-4a19e.firebaseapp.com).

#### Environment

All the participants should use the same device for testing. Don't let them use their own device. We recommend to use mobile device, not laptop.

- In mobile **[Recommended]** - Chrome application.
- In laptop - Chrome browser. Only using mobile mode in development tool(shortcut: F12). Toggle device toolbar(shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + M) and select "Galaxy S5" at leftmost dropdown menu in device toolbar header.

#### Accounts for test

The ID must be made before the experiment because it should has the previous plans. If user signs in our service, he/she cannot use 'load' function.

> ID : test / PW : 1234

#### Pre-dataset

There should be pre-dataset in test account.

> 3 past days, 2-3 workouts for each day, 3-6 sets for each workout, no plan at the day.

### Introduction

> Your workout is a real training session only if you have specific goals, a planned vision of progress and a way to measure your results. From this reason, some people record their workouts. However, tracking workouts is an annoying task. Our team has focused on **"How to track your workouts in the simplest, most effective way possble"**.
> 
> MACHOKE - your workout note - is designed for providing technical aids to reduce the troublesomeness of recording workout results and to make the process of tracking each exercise details easier.
> 
> And we want to test the usability of our product by this user testing, and get some feedbacks.

### Informed consent

> I confirm that the participant was given an opportunity to ask questions about the user testing, and all the questions asked by the participant have been answered correctly and to the best of my ability. I confirm that the individual has not been coerced into giving consent, and the consent has been given freely and voluntarily.

> print the name of researcher/person talking to the consent: * * *

### Task list

#### **Task 1**: Log in and add new plans

> First, you can log in our service with this given test acount, ID is 'test' and password is '1234'. Next, in the main screen, please tap 'add new workout' button, and add plans you want to do.

#### **Task 2**: Complete workout plans

> If you fininshed to add plans, select one of the plans and start exercising. Please tell us if you have any difficulties until you do all the plans.

- Did you find our service useful? If so, which features or aspects were impressive?
- Was our overall design (including buttons, header, front page, etc) looked fancy enough?
- Is there anything you need while doing exercise, which is beyond our service?

#### Adding plan

- Was there any inconvenience while adding new workout plan? If so, let us know so that we can improve our service.

#### Daily plan list & Recording exercises

- How did you like our list view which showed each one's daily routine?
- Was there any notable inconvenience while doing an exercise with our UI?
- How was our timer which showed your rest interval between sets? Was it learnable?

#### Loading workout routines from calendar

- How do you often do workout routime that is similar to the one you'd done in the past?
- How did you like our calendar? Was there any good or bads?
- Did you find any inconvenience while loading?

### Debrief prompt

Our team is planning to show out our gratitude towards paricipants by giving our starbucks or equivalent gifticon as we did in the previous user testings. (paper & low-fi prototypes)

## Session observations

> Participants: Who are they? How did you recruit them? Why are they representative target users? Add brief demographic, context information about each participant that is relevant to your interface.

> Use at least one photo or sketch for each participant and provide a summary description of each session (e.g., What was unique about this participant? Main takeaway from this participant?).

### Participant 1

> **Joonhwan, Choi**
> [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qLfDViR6CWM) of screen captures video during the testing

#### Observations

- He sometimes didn't tap 'NEXT' button before starting next set.
- He changes 'repetition' during exercising a lot. We have thought that many users will plan strictly, but he plans roughly and change details after each set of workout.
- He doesn't focus on the text. There are two buttons 'Add more set' and 'Go to main' after finishing all the sets, but he doesn't read the text and tap what he doesn't want.
- It takes a lot of time to add plans. He doesn't find the name of workout fast.
- He taps plan buttons in list instead of header. (These two buttons have same function.)
- He does well in using the timer for break time.
- He uses a large value of weight. To reach 62kg from 20kg, he taps + button 42 times.
- He doesn't plan all the workout he will do today, but plan one workout.

#### Interview

### Participant 2

> **geonho, Park**
> [youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWcvg062k-Q) of screen captures video during the testing

#### Observations

- He wonders the difference of 'add' and 'confirm' buttons.
- He taps the picture instead of workout name in 'add' page.
- He wants to plan the next workout during the break time. But the user cannot do anything during the break time in our service.

#### Interview

## Usability lessons

> List at least 10 usability problems you discovered. Organize them by high-level task or theme, not by each participant or time. But mention which participant ran into the problem by referring to them as P1, P2, ... (e.g., search results did not show the price information (P1, P3)). For each problem, indicate how critical the problem is: high, medium, and low. Finally, show how you plan to address each of the problems.

> High-level reflections: What did you overall learn from the user testing experience? What would you do differently for better results and insights?

## Studio reflections

> Summarize the feedback from the studio session, and mention how you addressed it or will address it later in the process.

## Plan for iteration

> You'll have an additional week to finalize your overall design process. Discuss in your team how to use this time most effectively, and make a few concrete goals. Justify your goals.
